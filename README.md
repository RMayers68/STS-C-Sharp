Program: Slay the Spire in C# (Console Application)

I created this huge product (for me) to further my learning of core programming principles.
I had schooling at DeVry University where we went over several languages: Java, Python, and C++.
We also did mobile app designing and reverse engineering. However, I felt like the classes scratched 
just the surface, so I wanted to make a large project where I could reinforce my learning. If you have any feedback,
I would love to hear it. Thank you and have a nice day!

This is not the full Slay The Spire application, I did not code in these following features:
- Act 4 and related equipment to access
- Card Rarity for Card reward selections
- Several Relics and Events

There are a few bugs present in this game which the plans is to occasionally fix in between other projects. Known bugs are
- Relic Shop prices being set to 0.
- Storm of Steel only returning 1 Shiv regardless of number of cards discarded.
