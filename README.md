If you are reading this, I have likely shared access as a step of applying to your company! 
I created this huge product (for me) to further my learning of core programming principles.
I had schooling at DeVry University where we went over several languages: Java, Python, and C++.
We also did mobile app designing and reverse engineering. However, I felt like the classes scratched 
just the surface. Online tutorials will make you feel there is no end to what you don't know,
so I decided to challenge myself to make a project without external guides or help. If you have any feedback,
I would love to hear it. Thank you and have a nice day!
